European Social Survey

A workbook and R-Studio project material on an analysis of European Social Survey data. 
Summary of the study is at  https://hidingindata.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/happiness-and-european-parliament-adventures-in-european-social-survey-data/

I believe most active phase of this project starts to be behind and updates / changes will not happen very often 
anymore. Need to move on.

However, there can be mistakes / errors / ambiguities / clarifications I need to address later on.
Any feedback / comments appreciated.
